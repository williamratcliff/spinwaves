- A bond can be deactivated, but nothing happens until "generate" button is pressed.
  However, if the session is saved and reloaded, it is as if the "generate" button was pressed.
  Deactivated bonds dissapear.
  
- Scroll bars should be added to bond and parameter windows.

- menu names could be changed/reorganized.

- Code could be reogranized to 1) fit MVC 2)organize GUI Main into several files.

-minor, but in Session file, line ~951, it seems that translating the atom back to the first cuttoff cell should
be unneccessary since it must exist as an internal-cellular bond to have translated to an intercellular bond.

-Look into safe ways of killing processes.  Right now, the terminate() method is used, which has the potential to
corrupt the queue if it is being accessed when the process is terminated.

-Make bond and parameter frames have a scroll bar when their size increases, rather than
automatically increasing the frame size.

-Before Closing, check if work has been saved.
