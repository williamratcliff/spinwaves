Calculating the Cross Section
=============================

To calculate the cross section, go to "Perform Cross Section Calculation" in the "Compute" menu in the main window.  You will be asked to enter the interaction and spin files.  The interaction file contains the interactions in between atoms in the lattice and the spin file contains the ground state spins.  For more information, see :doc:`ground_state`.
