Calculating Dispersion
======================

To calculate the dispersion, go to "Perform Spinwave Calculation" in the "Compute" menu on the main window.  You will be asked to enter the paths to an interaction file and a spin file.  These are described in the section :doc:`ground_state`.  The first file is contains all the atom interactions in the lattice and the second contains the ground state spins.

You must enter the starting and ending values of k to be graphed as well as the number of steps, which is the resolution of the graph.  Then you must enter the x, y, and z components of the scan direction.

When all the information is entered, click the 'ok' button.  Two processes will start, one which will attempt to analytically find an expression for the dispersion, and another will will find a numerical solution and graph it.
