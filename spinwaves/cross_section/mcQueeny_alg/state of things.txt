The python implementation you have in the folder py_imp works in that it
produces the same results as McQueeny's code and my hand calculation using
McQueeny's algorithm, both for the simple anti-ferromagnet.

Right now this just produces the structure factor.  I left out k'/k, r_0,
formfactor...

You still need to fix up the C version and CUDA C version to match this version.

Right now I am working on trying to get the same numbers as the paper for the
body-center cubic anti-ferromagnet.  I tried using space group 229 with 2 atoms
in the unit cell with the python code in py_imp and did not get the smae answer
as the paper.  Now I am playing with mCQueeny's code to try to get it - I
just started doingthis and haven't gotten any results yet.  The code in
spinwave_fortran/spnwaves_mcqueeny/source_mod should be set up to do this -
Everything but the structure factor has been commented out.


I think Bill's code is probably wrong becuase I just get a constant structure
factor for any lattice I try (I removed k'/k, other constants, etc.)

Road Forward:
Verify the BCC case (hopefully)
Get C code to match python and mcqueeny
Get CUDA C code to match python and mcqueeny / port ZGEEV to CUDA
