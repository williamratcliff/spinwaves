DEPENDENCIES:

	-Python 2.5-2.6
	-wxPython
	-numpy
	-matplotlib
	-sympy
	-scipy
	-vtk

	Most Linux distrobutions will come with a version of Python.  To check
	your version, open python in the shell.  The version will be printed.

	Vtk can be aqcuired from:
	www.vtk.org

	All other dependencies should be handled automatically by setuptools
	when the setup.py script is run.  However, since this has proven to be
	error-prone alternate methods of resolving these dependencies have been
	given below.

	
	Ubuntu/Debian/Any Distrobution using Aptitude Users:
	
	A schell script has been included to automatically download all
	dependencies (other than Python itself) using aptitude.  The script
	will download and install the current versions of numpy, matplotlib,
	sympy, scipy, and vtk.  wxPython2.8 will be installed, although 2.6 will
	work as well.

INSTALLING:

	After reading the section above on dependencies, simply install by
	opening a shell in the spinwaves top level directory and typing:
	
		sudo python setup.py install

	You should now be able to run the spinwaves application by typing
	'spinwaves' in the shell.
